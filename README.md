### An unofficial re-write of [Compact Machines 4](https://github.com/CompactMods/CompactMachines) for the Fabric mod loader.
### WARNING: Still highly experimental. Expect breaking changes.
<br>
Minecraft Mod. Adds one simple game mechanic: Small rooms inside of blocks.

You can grab the latest build (tagged) in the releases tab.

## Compact Machines

These are the main component of this mod and allow you to build complicated machine contraptions and hide them within a single Compact Machine block.

#### Sizes
There are 6 different sizes of machines:

| Name    | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Tiny    | 3x3x3       |
| Small   | 5x5x5       |
| Normal  | 7x7x7       |
| Large   | 9x9x9       |
| Giant   | 11x11x11    |
| Maximum | 13x13x13    |

#### Personal Shrinking Device

This little tool allows you to enter your Compact Machines. Right-clicking a Compact Machine world will teleport you inside.

#### Spawn location

By default, you spawn in the center of the room. You can change this by shift-right-clicking a Personal Shrinking Device at the location you want to set the spawn to.

Make sure not to obstruct the spawn location, there is currently no mechanic to automatically search for a better spawn location. You don't want to have to break the blocks you spawn in.

## Tunnels
Tunnels are not yet implemented.
